# 🌌 Asteroid Classification Project 🛰️

Welcome to the Asteroid Classification Project! 🚀 This project delves into the fascinating world of asteroids, minor planets orbiting within the inner Solar System. Unlike true planets or comets with tails, asteroids exhibit diverse characteristics and compositions. Join us as we explore and classify these celestial bodies using advanced data analysis and classification algorithms. 🌠

## Overview 🪐

Asteroids have been observed from Earth for centuries. With around one million known asteroids, they vary widely in:

- Size: From small rubble piles (<1 km) to larger bodies like Ceres (~1000 km). 📏
- Shape: Ranging from irregular and fragmented to more spherical formations. 🔵🔺
- Composition: Rocky, metallic, icy, or a combination of these materials. 🪨🪙❄️
- Orbital Dynamics: Classified based on parameters such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. 🌌

## Project Focus 🌟

Our project primarily focuses on the orbital classification of asteroids. We employ the Hierarchical Clustering Method (HCM), considering parameters like:

- Proper semi-major axis (a) 🛤️
- Eccentricity (e) 📈
- Inclination (i) 🔄

In HCM, asteroids are grouped based on their distances in these domains or frequencies. If an asteroid's distance from others falls below a predefined threshold (cut-off), it is classified into the same family. This conventional approach demands significant computational resources. 💻

## Goals 🎯

- Utilize diverse exploratory data analysis methods to scrutinize asteroid data and features. 🔍
- Extract vital trends and patterns conducive to classification. 📊
- Implement classification algorithms to improve efficiency, ensuring a swifter and less computationally burdensome solution. 🚀
- Enhance classification algorithms for better accuracy. 🧠
- Explore additional features for classification. 🔍
- Optimize the computational efficiency of the HCM approach. ⚡
