An asteroid, a minor planet orbiting within the inner Solar System, lacks a true planet's characteristics or a comet's tail. With approximately one million known asteroids, they have historically been observed from Earth. Asteroids, diverse in their composition and characteristics, exhibit a wide range of properties. These properties include size, shape, composition, and orbital dynamics. Size variations span from small rubble piles measuring under a kilometre across to larger bodies like Ceres, a dwarf planet nearly 1000 km in diameter. Compositionally, asteroids can be rocky, metallic, or icy, with some exhibiting combinations of these materials. Their shapes range from irregular and fragmented to more spherical formations.
Asteroids are typically classified based on their orbit characteristics and reflectance spectrum features. Our project primarily focuses on orbital classification, with parameters such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination often utilized for categorization. Hierarchical clustering method (HCM) is commonly utilized for this purpose, considering parameters such as proper semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), and inclination (i). In HCM, asteroids are grouped based on their distances in these domains or frequencies. If an asteroid's distance from other falls below a predefined threshold (cut-off), it's classified into the same family. 
The conventional HCM approach demands significant computational resources. Our project seeks to utilize diverse exploratory data analysis methods to scrutinize asteroid data and features, extracting vital trends and patterns conducive to classification. We aim to implement classification algorithms to improve efficiency, ensuring a swifter and less computationally burdensome solution to the aforementioned challenge.
